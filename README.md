# ðŸŽ£ Crystal Catch â€“ Puls Game Jam 2025
Step onto the frozen lake, where serene beauty meets thrilling challenge. In Crystal Catch, you have 10 minutes to catch as many fish as you can â€” without breaking through the ice!

The gentle glow of the Northern Lights dances faintly in the sky, adding a touch of magic to your icy adventure. Stay calm, cast your line, and carefully balance your movements. Every successful catch inches you closer to a high score, but every wrong move could send you plunging into the freezing depths.

Crystal Catch was developed as part of the Puls Game Jam 2025. Built within a limited timeframe, this charming ice-fishing adventure invites you to test your skills and patience on thin ice.

# ðŸŽ® Controls â€“ How to Play Crystal Catch
Move: Use W, A, S, D to carefully walk across the ice. Watch your step â€” the surface is fragile!
Fish: Press the Spacebar to cast your line. Hold it to reel in fish, then release to catch them.
Store Your Catch: Once you've caught a fish, walk close to the Storage Crate to automatically place your fish inside.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Keep moving and balancing your steps to avoid falling through the ice!

Will you master the ice and prove yourself as the ultimate angler? Or will the crystal-clear waters claim another victim.
